Fastp Quality Control
=====================

Fastp performs read filtering, adapter trimming, and quality profiling.

The report shows:

- Number of reads before and after filtering
- Quality score distribution
- Adapter trimming details
- GC content
- Duplication rate

The HTML file provides interactive plots, and the JSON file can be used for downstream parsing.
